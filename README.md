🍔 Food Ordering SQL Analytics Project
📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a Food Ordering System and demonstrates how SQL can be used to extract valuable business insights from raw order data. The database includes customers, restaurants, cuisines, orders, and promotions, and the queries address real-world business problems around customer acquisition, retention, and sales performance.

One-Time Customers in Jan 2025 – Counted customers who placed only one order in Jan 2025 and never returned.

Inactive Customers – Listed users with no orders in the last 7 days, who joined a month ago with their first order on a promo code.

Customer Retention Triggers – Wrote a query to identify customers after every 3rd order for personalized marketing communication.

Promo-Only Customers – Found customers who placed all their orders using promo codes.
